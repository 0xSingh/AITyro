**_Prompt:_**

> monkey king, snow, moon, mountain range

## Prompt Engineering

In above example, the images are clearly different from one another, and that's largely due to the lack of specific instructions in the prompts. A more detailed prompt can guide the model to produce results that align closely with your vision.

**_Let's try to expand our prompt:_**

> Create a scene with the Monkey King standing on a snow-covered mountain range under a full moon. The moonlight illuminates the snow, highlighting the Monkey Kingâ€™s golden staff. Capture his playful yet powerful presence against the dramatic peaks and soft clouds in the night sky

**_Result:_**

<table style={{ marginTop: '-5%' }}>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>![](/static/images/blog/17.png)</td>
      <td>![](/static/images/blog/18.png)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

_Now do you feel the difference? The lack of clear instructions led to unexpected results. However, when we use a bit more detail in our prompts, the images start to look more similar and aligned with our vision._

**This little experiment shows how important it is to be specificâ€”detailed prompts can guide Fooocus to produce the cohesive results youâ€™re aiming for. So, donâ€™t hesitate to add those extra details and watch your ideas come to life!**

## Advanced Settings

Selecting the Advanced checkbox at the bottom of the UI opens up the advanced settings menu.

### Preset

Fooocus offers built-in presets, and for now, let's stick with the **default** option to keep things simple and effective.

<table style={{ marginTop: '-5%' }}>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ width: '33.3%' }}>![](/static/images/blog/22.png)</td>
      <td style={{ width: '33.4%' }}>![](/static/images/blog/23.png)</td>
      <td style={{ width: '33.3%' }}>![](/static/images/blog/24.png)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>anime</td>
      <td>realistic</td>
      <td>sai</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Performance

Choose from a range of performance settings to match your needs: **Quality**, **Speed**, **Extreme Speed**, **Lightning**, and **Hyper-SD**. Select the one that fits your project best!

<table style={{ marginTop: '-5%' }}>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ width: '33.3%' }}>![](/static/images/blog/19.png)</td>
      <td style={{ width: '33.4%' }}>![](/static/images/blog/20.png)</td>
      <td style={{ width: '33.3%' }}>![](/static/images/blog/21.png)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hyper-SD</td>
      <td>Extreme Speed</td>
      <td>Quality</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Aspect Ratio

You have the flexibility to use any resolution you like. Adjust the aspect ratio to create images that perfectly fit your vision.

### Add Custom Aspect Ratio

Want even more control? You can add custom resolutions in the `modules/flags.py` file. Simply go to the line containing the variable `sdxl_aspect_ratios`, and below it, add a new line like this:

```python
sdxl_aspect_ratios.append("width*height")
```

Example: if you wanna add 1440p resolution then

```python
sdxl_aspect_ratios.append("2560*1440")`
```

This way, you can tailor the aspect ratios to suit your specific needs!

### Image Number

Specify the number of images you want to generate for each prompt. More images mean more creative options to choose from!

### Output Format

Select your preferred output format for the generated images. Whether you need JPEG, PNG, or something else, Fooocus has you covered.

### Negative Prompt

A negative prompt is like giving instructions on what to avoid. It helps guide the model by specifying elements you donâ€™t want. For example, if you want to steer clear of anything inappropriate, you can add terms like "nudity, nsfw, sexual themes."

### Seed (aka Random)

By default, Fooocus shows this option as **Random**. This means a new seed is generated each time, creating unique results. A "seed" is a numerical value that initializes the random number generator for image creation. If you want consistent and reproducible results, you can set a specific seed number for your runs. This way, you can recreate that perfect image whenever you need it!

## Consistent Results

Fooocus also offers a fantastic array of options to help you achieve consistent results. One exciting feature is the ability to mix text and image prompts for truly incredible outcomes!

### Steps to Create an Image Prompt

1.  **Click on `Input Image`**: Start by selecting the image you want to use.
2.  **Go to `Image Prompt`**: Navigate to the image prompt settings.
3.  **Turn on `Advanced`**: Enable the Advanced option at the bottom of the dialog.
4.  **Choose Your Image**: Select the image you want to base your results on.
5.  **Select `Faceswap`**: This will allow you to blend features effectively.
6.  **Use the Default Config**: The default settings work great for most cases!

Now, when you type your text prompt and hit generate, the resulting face will resemble the face from your image prompt, infused with details drawn from your text. Itâ€™s a powerful way to bring your ideas to life with striking detail!

<table style={{}}>

    <tr>
      <td style={{ width: '25%', padding: 0, border: '1px solid' }}>
        ![](/static/images/blog/26.png)

      <td style={{ width: '25%', padding: 0, border: '1px solid' }}>

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Base image</td>
      <td>Text Prompt 1</td>
      <td>Text Prompt 2</td>
      <td>Text Prompt 3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

I adjusted the **StopAt** value to 0.95 and set the **weight** to 0.9 because my base image had green eyes, which can be tricky for Stable Diffusion to replicate. After making these changes, I noticed a significant improvementâ€”Stable Diffusion started capturing the eye features much more accurately!

These tweaks really helped enhance the results, allowing for finer details and a closer match to the original image. Itâ€™s amazing how small adjustments can lead to such a big difference in the final output!
