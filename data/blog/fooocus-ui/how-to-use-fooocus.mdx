## Prompt Engineering

In above example, the images are clearly different from one another, and that's largely due to the lack of specific instructions in the prompts. A more detailed prompt can guide the model to produce results that align closely with your vision.

**_Let's try to expand our prompt:_**

> Create a scene with the Monkey King standing on a snow-covered mountain range under a full moon. The moonlight illuminates the snow, highlighting the Monkey Kingâ€™s golden staff. Capture his playful yet powerful presence against the dramatic peaks and soft clouds in the night sky

**_Result:_**

<table style={{ marginTop: '-5%' }}>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>![](/static/images/blog/17.png)</td>
      <td>![](/static/images/blog/18.png)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

_Now do you feel the difference? The lack of clear instructions led to unexpected results. However, when we use a bit more detail in our prompts, the images start to look more similar and aligned with our vision._

**This little experiment shows how important it is to be specificâ€”detailed prompts can guide Fooocus to produce the cohesive results youâ€™re aiming for. So, donâ€™t hesitate to add those extra details and watch your ideas come to life!**
