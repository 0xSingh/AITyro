**With numerous UIs available for starting with Stable Diffusion, it can be a bit overwhelming for beginners. To make it more accessible, I’ve divided the setup into three different levels.**

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Introduction" />

**Level 1:** Designed for absolute beginners who just want to dive into text-to-image generators without any extra effort.

**Level 2:** Intermediate users can step in here. If you already have a grasp of Stable Diffusion basics, this level guides you to integrate various add-ons for more advanced features.

**Level 3:** Geared towards absolute pros, this level unlocks a wealth of power, allowing you to even automate processes. While there’s no strict rule against trying Level 3 first, it’s generally better to progress from top to bottom. With dedication, you can move through each level fairly quickly and explore the full potential of this amazing technology.

## 👶Level 1: Focus On Prompt

At this level, we’ll pick a UI that doesn’t overwhelm with too many customization options to keep things simple for absolute beginners. There are several user-friendly UIs available today to kick-start your Stable Diffusion journey. Here are a few selected UIs for you:
