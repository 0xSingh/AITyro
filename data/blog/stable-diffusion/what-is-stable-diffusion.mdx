<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Introduction" />

## What is Stable Diffusion?

Stable Diffusion, as showcased on [stability.ai](https://stability.ai/), is like having a super-smart digital assistant. Imagine youâ€™re trying to turn your written words into cool pictures. This technology does that smoothly and reliably, ensuring your ideas come to life visually. Itâ€™s a bit like a friendly digital artist that helps you share information clearly and steadily.

Images generated by this can be hyper-realistic, like a professional photo shoot or an artistic style. The best part is itâ€™s FREE.

## What makes Stable Diffusion a good choice?

You might have come across **DALLE, Midjourney, Leonardo,** and other high-end AI models for transforming text into images. Wondering why choose Stable Diffusion AI? Well, hereâ€™s the scoop:

1.  **Itâ€™s FREE & open-source:** Thanks to its open-source nature, numerous smart enthusiasts have dedicated countless hours to creating add-ons. These not only boost its features but also amp up Stable Diffusionâ€™s performance.
2.  **Designed for low-power computers:** Yes, you can even run it on a basic computer, even if itâ€™s as humble as a potato PC!

## Will it work on my PC?

Stable Diffusion is getting better every day, with high optimization and increasing support for various environments. However, keep in mind that not all features are available on every type of system.

#### Does Stable Diffusion work on NVIDIA GPU?

Yes! stable diffusion has the best support for NVIDIA cards on both Linux and Windows.

#### Does Stable Diffusion work on AMD GPU?

Sort of! The support for AMD cards isnâ€™t as strong as it is for NVIDIA cards at the moment.

But thereâ€™s good news! AMD just introduced **_ROCm_**, and soon youâ€™ll be able to experience Stable Diffusion to the fullest. I suggest opting for _Ubuntu_ over _Windows_ if youâ€™re using an AMD card, as Windows can still be a bit glitchy and might throw a bunch of errors your way.
